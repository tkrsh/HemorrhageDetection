# HemorrhageDetection
Our model can detect acute intracranial haemorrhage and its sub types with inference times less than 1 second and accuracy greater than 85%. We aim to provide automated, faster and more accurate diagnosis using computer vision and deep residual learning frameworks for image recognition and classification
