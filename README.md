Abstract : Intracranial hemorrhage, bleeding that occurs inside the cranium, is a serious health problem requiring
rapid and often intensive medical treatment. Such a condition is traditionally diagnosed by highly
trained specialists analyzing a Computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient and identifying the
location and type of hemorrhage if one exists. When a patient shows acute neurological symptoms such
as severe headache or loss of consciousness, highly trained specialists review medical images of the
patientâ€™s cranium to look for the presence, location and type of hemorrhage. The process is complicated
and often time consuming as these scans are essentially a combination of multiple X-Ray scans
processed by a computer. To reduce delays which lead to deaths we propose a solution to this problem
based on a Machine Vision based approach to automate the detection of intracranial hemorrhaging. We
employ a modified version of ResNet 34 trained on a dataset provided by Radiological Society of North
America. These convolutional networks are then stacked using a sequence model (such as a recurrent
neural network) to preserve temporal information. The system can detect acute intracranial hemorrhage
and its subtypes with inference times less than 1 second and accuracy greater than 85%. We aim to
provide automated, faster and more accurate diagnosis using computer vision and deep residual learning
frameworks for image recognition and classification
